Developers across the world are rapidly adopting DDD principles to deliver powerful results when writing software that deals with complex business requirements.

* Avoid common pitfalls when creating the domain model 
* Study the concept of Bounded Context and aggregate 
* Design and build temporal models based on behavior and not only data 
* Explore benefits and drawbacks of Event Sourcing 
Get acquainted with CQRS and to-the-point read models with projections 
Practice building one-way flow UI with Vue.js 
Understand how a task-based UI conforms to DDD principles
