**Tackling complexity in the heart of software by putting DDD principles into practice**

## What is this book about?
Developers across the world are rapidly adopting DDD principles to deliver powerful results when writing software that deals with complex business requirements. This book will guide you in involving business stakeholders when choosing the software you are planning to build for them. By figuring out the temporal nature of behavior-driven domain models, you will be able to build leaner, more agile, and modular systems.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover and resolve domain complexity together with business stakeholders 
* Avoid common pitfalls when creating the domain model 
* Study the concept of Bounded Context and aggregate 
* Design and build temporal models based on behavior and not only data 
* Explore benefits and drawbacks of Event Sourcing 
Get acquainted with CQRS and to-the-point read models with projections 
Practice building one-way flow UI with Vue.js 
Understand how a task-based UI conforms to DDD principles
